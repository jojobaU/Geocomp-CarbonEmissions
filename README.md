# Geocomp-Carbon Emissions
Geocomputation in R - Data used: London spatial data, london government data
  - This project is modeled after a https://github.com/Robinlovelace/Creating-maps-in-R.
  - The two data variables being used are the London boroughs' total carbon emission levels for 2012 and 2014

Purpose of this project
  - To develop knowledge using the R programming language's exciting visualization capabilities
  - To use the data given to create segmented maps identifying which boroughs excude the most carbon emissions
  - To create tmaps, powered by leaflet, to create interactive and colored visualizations showing the most carbon emission dense 
    boroughs
